# Barracuda Tools
A branching web form, using mostly client-side rendering and processing power, that will perform any minor functions strictly related to a Barracuda product. This project is **intended** for use by Barracuda Networks Technical Support as a consolidated tool but may be used by any savvy administrator or MSP.

Components of this project (list will continue to grow):
+ [X] _LinkProtect Unwrapper_ - Automatically unwrap and decode links that have been wrapped with
+ [ ] _FilterFixer_ - A revitalization and improvement of the ESG-to-ESS filter fixer tool, originally pioneered by _Eric Gillett_ and _Jason Olsson_.
